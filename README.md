# dog_breeeds

This model takes a picture and creates sub pictures to be run on our base dog breed classification model.
The initial classifier was made using openAi's mobilenet design and retrained on a data set from kaggle

This was proof of concept that I could break down pictures into smaller pieces and use a model that was trained on images that were not sub devided.
This uses concepts such as transfer learning, backpropegation, and was inspired by the radial basis function
